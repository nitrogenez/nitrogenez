# Hi. Name's Andrew.

I'm a 29 y.o developer. My heart belongs to my fianc√©. I'm a well-experienced C++ developer. If you want to chat, be my guest. I'm available almost 24/7 on Matrix, link to which you may find somewhere down this readme.  

I'm not quite good at collaboration and team work, but I will try, if there's a need for that. I'm a social media hater because of MySpace and Facebook thing. But still kinda using it. Once a month.  

I don't like Rust, but still use it from time to time, because it's fun. I mainly use C++, and don't use C at all, because it's not safe at all, and I'm a dumbass. However, I recently discovered Zig, so I'm slowly returning to C from time to time, just because I love it.  

I have experience in malware development, and system programming. Ah, these old days. Anyways, I'm open to communication and will help if needed.
