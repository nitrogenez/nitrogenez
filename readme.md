# Hi. Name's Andrew.

29 y.o programmer. I like to be left alone and doing my job. Wanna chat? Be my guest. My contacts are down in the readme.  
Primarily work with Zig now. Worked with C++ before. I liked it. But Zig is too good to be left behind yet.  
I'm not active. I'm almost always busy with my job and house chores.
